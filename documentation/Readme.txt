focus on smaller problems first
define strategies
list possible strategies (not too many, i.e. 5)
1. d.a.c. : Click as many times as possible
2. Rotation: make 1 firgure, rotate it 4 times, next figure
3. Subpar: Does not understand the objective at hand
4. Additive: Add 1 more line to your figure untill it is completely filled
5. substractive: Remove 1 line until you have 1 or 0 left
6. Single: click 1 line until all 8 lines make 8 different figures


How do we visualise i.e. 4: additive

for each session, check the first pattern. if the next pattern is 1 more, up the count by 1.
then go to the next pattern and compare that to the next one. If the count ever reaches 4, they are additive.
reset the count if it doesn't check the condition
